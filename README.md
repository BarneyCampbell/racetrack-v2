# Racetrack-v2
A re-implementation of my final year project.

For my final year project I implemented the Racetrack game, https://racetrack-94772.web.app/.

I am incredibly proud of the final product, but I want to do it better. That is the purpose of this project.

## Outline

My original implementation used JavaScript to implement the game, as well as all the algorithmic aspects. By starting again, I can create the representations of players etc. from scratch and exactly how I can best use them.
This is also an opportunity for me to explore graphics development for applications that aren't web-based.

## Improvements

Here I will list my improvements.

- Co-ordinates are represented using my own system, rather than the graphics library representation.
